# üìä Insurance Claim Data Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **insurance risk and claims data** using **Excel** and **Power BI**.  
The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that helps understand policyholder demographics, vehicle risks, and claim behaviors.  
By cleaning and transforming the dataset, the analysis provides valuable insights for better decision-making.

## üéØ Problem Statement
The insurance company faced challenges in understanding policyholder and claims performance due to scattered data sources.  

The main objectives of the analysis include:  
- Measuring **total policies and claims**  
- Tracking **claim frequency and average claim amount**  
- Segmenting customers by **age, gender, marital status, and education**  
- Analyzing **vehicle-related risk factors** (car make, year, usage type)  
- Identifying **geographic claim patterns**  
- Understanding **household dynamics** such as the impact of kids driving

## Tools Used
- **Excel** ‚Üí for cleaning and preparing the data  
- **Power BI** ‚Üí for modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation  

---

## Data Cleaning
- Corrected data types for numeric, categorical, and date fields  
- Handled missing values using replacement and removal  
- Created calculated columns like *Age* (from birthdate) and *Car Age* (from car year)  
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., education levels, marital status, car make)  
- Built relationships in Power BI for time-based and demographic analysis

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Key Business Questions**

- How do **total claims** vary across demographics and vehicles?  
- Which **age groups** and **genders** show higher claim frequency?  
- Which **car makes and years** have higher risks?  
- How do claims differ across **geographic zones**?

## Results
Some highlights from the dashboard:  
- Personal cars accounted for the majority of claims (~$150M vs $37M for commercial)  
- Ford and Chevrolet had the highest claim amounts  
- Claims were evenly distributed across coverage zones (~$37M each)  
- Claims peaked in the 46‚Äì65 age group  
- Households without kids driving had the highest total claims (~$134M)  
- Single policyholders with High School or Bachelor‚Äôs education filed the most claims

## üí° Recommendations
- **Risk-Based Premiums:** Adjust pricing for high-claim car makes, car years, and demographics  
- **Geographic Insights:** Create zone-specific policies or targeted offers  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Design products for single vs married customers and education-based groups  
- **Youth Driver Programs:** Introduce safe-driving initiatives for households with kids driving  
- **Vehicle Risk Management:** Encourage adoption of safer, newer cars with discounts or incentives
